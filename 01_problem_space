Many organizations in Brazil adopted cloud platforms rapidly,
often without trained teams, security baselines or governance models.

Common issues observed:
- Overprivileged identities and lack of IAM strategy
- Publicly exposed storage
- No audit logging or monitoring
- No incident response planning
- Regulatory and compliance risks

These gaps increase the likelihood of data breaches,
service disruption and long-term operational dependency.
