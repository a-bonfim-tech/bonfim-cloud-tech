# Governance & Compliance Model — LGPD-Ready

Governance is embedded by design at Bonfim Cloud Tech.
Compliance is treated as an outcome of good architecture, not paperwork.

## Governance Objectives
- Define clear ownership and accountability
- Ensure security controls are consistently applied
- Reduce regulatory and operational risk
- Enable auditability and transparency
- Support scalable and repeatable operations

## Governance Principles
- Responsibility is explicit, never implicit
- Policies are enforceable through architecture
- Least privilege and separation of duties
- Continuous improvement over static compliance
- Evidence over declarations

## Governance Domains
The governance model covers five domains:
1. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
2. Data and Storage
3. Network and Infrastructure
4. Operations and Incident Response
5. Compliance and Risk Management

Each domain has defined owners, controls and review cycles.

## Roles and Responsibilities
- Executive Sponsor: strategic oversight and accountability
- Security Owner: definition and enforcement of security controls
- Data Owner: classification, access approval and retention
- System Owner: operational integrity and availability
- Auditor (internal/external): independent verification

No role owns everything. Duties are separated by design.

## Policy Framework
Core policies include:
- Access Control Policy
- Data Classification and Protection Policy
- Logging and Monitoring Policy
- Incident Response Policy
- Change Management Policy

Policies are:
- Versioned
- Reviewed periodically
- Enforced through technical controls

## LGPD Alignment
This governance model aligns with LGPD principles:
- Purpose limitation
- Data minimization
- Access control and confidentiality
- Transparency and accountability
- Security and breach readiness

Personal data handling is mapped to:
- Data classification
- Access justification
- Retention and deletion rules

## Risk Management
- Risks are identified per domain
- Impact and likelihood are assessed
- Mitigations are documented
- Residual risk is explicitly accepted or reduced

Risk registers are living documents.

## Audit and Evidence
- All critical actions are logged
- Logs are immutable and retained
- Access reviews are documented
- Architecture diagrams serve as audit artifacts

Audit readiness is continuous, not event-based.

## Change and Exception Management
- Changes require documented approval
- Emergency changes are logged and reviewed
- Exceptions are time-bound and justified
- Configuration drift is monitored

No permanent exceptions are allowed.

## Governance Outcomes
This governance model ensures:
- Reduced misconfiguration risk
- Clear accountability
- Faster incident response
- Regulatory readiness
- Long-term operational resilience

Governance is not an add-on. It is infrastructure.
