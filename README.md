# Bonfim Cloud Tech

Bonfim Cloud Tech is a cloud-native technology initiative focused on
cloud security, governance, compliance and resilient architectures.

The company is designed to support organizations in underprepared
regions, such as parts of Brazil, that have adopted cloud services
without proper security, IAM, governance or cyber resilience.

Our mission is to prevent organizations from becoming cyber hostages
due to misconfigurations, lack of identity control, insecure storage
and absence of governance models.

## Focus Areas
- Cloud Architecture (cloud-first, security-by-design)
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Zero Trust principles
- Secure storage and data protection
- Governance, risk and compliance (GRC)
- Cyber resilience and incident readiness

## Initial Geographic Focus
- Brazil (Aracaju / Northeast)
- Expansion-ready by design

## Status
Active development. Documentation-first approach.
