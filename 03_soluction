Bonfim Cloud Tech proposes a cloud architecture model based on:

- Cloud-native design principles
- Security by default
- Identity-first access control
- Segmentation and least privilege
- Continuous monitoring and logging

The architecture is designed to be:
- Scalable
- Auditable
- Vendor-aware but not vendor-locked
- Adaptable to small and medium organizations
