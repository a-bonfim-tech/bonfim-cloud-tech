# Go-To-Market — Technical Positioning

Bonfim Cloud Tech enters the market as an architecture-led,
security-first cloud authority, not as a generic IT provider.

## Target Market
Primary:
- Small and medium organizations already using cloud
- Limited internal cloud/security expertise
- High exposure to misconfiguration and cyber risk

Geographic Focus:
- Brazil (Aracaju / Northeast) — initial
- Expansion-ready to similar regions

## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
- Uses public cloud (GCP/AWS/Azure)
- No formal IAM strategy
- No documented governance model
- Limited incident response capability
- Compliance pressure (LGPD awareness)

## Core Problems Addressed
- Overprivileged identities
- Exposed storage and data leakage risk
- Flat networks and implicit trust
- Lack of auditability and evidence
- Reactive, chaotic incident handling

## Positioning Statement
Bonfim Cloud Tech helps organizations that already adopted cloud
to regain control through identity-first security, governance by design
and resilient cloud architectures.

We replace improvisation with structure.

## Key Differentiators
- Architecture-first, not tool-first
- IAM as the primary security control
- Zero Trust applied pragmatically
- Governance embedded into infrastructure
- Documentation as a core deliverable

## Messaging Pillars
- “Cloud without governance is risk.”
- “Identity is the real perimeter.”
- “Security must be designed, not patched.”
- “Compliance is an outcome, not a checklist.”

## Entry Strategy
- Publish high-quality reference architectures
- Offer assessment-based engagements
- Lead with education and clarity
- Avoid fear-based selling

## Trust Signals
- Public documentation
- Transparent methodologies
- Architecture diagrams and playbooks
- Clear scope and outcomes

## Sales Motion (Early Stage)
- Direct outreach
- Referral-based introductions
- Educational sessions and workshops
- Low-friction initial assessments

## Success Metrics
- Reduced exposure findings
- Improved IAM posture
- Documented governance adoption
- Incident readiness improvements
- Client autonomy post-engagement

Bonfim Cloud Tech grows by building trust through structure,
not dependency.
