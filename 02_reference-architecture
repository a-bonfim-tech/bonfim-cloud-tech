# Identity and Access Management (IAM) — Reference Architecture

Identity is the primary security control of Bonfim Cloud Tech.
All access decisions are identity-driven, not network-driven.

## Core Principles
- Identity-first security
- Least privilege by default
- Explicit deny over implicit allow
- Separation of duties
- Continuous review and revocation

## Identity Domains
The architecture separates identities into clear domains:
- Human users (employees, contractors)
- Workload identities (services, APIs)
- External identities (partners, third parties)

Each domain has distinct policies and lifecycle controls.

## Authentication
- Strong authentication enforced for all human identities
- Mandatory MFA for privileged roles
- Centralized identity provider (IdP)
- No shared accounts

## Authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Fine-grained permissions
- Environment separation (prod / staging / dev)
- Privileged access requires time-bound elevation

## Service Accounts
- One service account per workload
- No reuse across services
- Minimal permissions required to operate
- Keyless authentication where possible

## Privileged Access Management (PAM)
- Admin access is exceptional, not normal
- Privileged roles are:
  - Time-limited
  - Logged
  - Reviewed periodically
- Break-glass accounts exist but are tightly controlled

## Logging and Audit
- All IAM actions are logged
- Logs are immutable and retained
- Access reviews are documented
- Audit trails are available for compliance

## Governance Controls
- Identity lifecycle management (joiner/mover/leaver)
- Periodic access reviews
- Policy versioning and change tracking
- Clear ownership of roles and permissions

## Security Outcomes
This IAM architecture reduces:
- Overprivileged access
- Lateral movement risk
- Credential abuse
- Insider threat impact

IAM is treated as infrastructure, not configuration.
