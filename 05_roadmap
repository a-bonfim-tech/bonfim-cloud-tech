# Roadmap — 90 Days Execution Plan

This roadmap translates the reference architecture into executable steps.
Focus: build authority, validate value, prepare for deployment.

## Phase 1 — Foundation (Days 1–30)
Objective: establish credibility, baseline architecture and MVP scope.

Deliverables:
- Finalize manifesto and problem statement
- Publish reference architectures:
  - IAM
  - Storage
  - Network Security
  - Zero Trust
- Define MVP scope and success criteria
- Create governance checklists (IAM, storage, network)
- Set up documentation standards and versioning

Outcomes:
- Clear positioning
- Public technical authority
- Architecture-first MVP definition

## Phase 2 — MVP Implementation (Days 31–60)
Objective: turn documentation into actionable artifacts.

Deliverables:
- Implement sample IAM model (least privilege)
- Create secure storage patterns
- Define network segmentation templates
- Produce incident response starter playbook
- Build compliance-ready documentation (LGPD-aligned)
- Prepare demo scenarios for small organizations

Outcomes:
- Practical, reusable security baseline
- Demonstrable value
- Ready-to-adapt reference implementations

## Phase 3 — Validation and Expansion (Days 61–90)
Objective: validate applicability and prepare for scale.

Deliverables:
- Pilot implementation with a small organization (non-commercial)
- Collect feedback and refine architectures
- Improve governance and compliance artifacts
- Prepare operational onboarding guide
- Define service offerings and engagement models

Outcomes:
- Validated approach
- Refined product offering
- Ready for formal commercialization

## Key Principles
- Documentation-first
- Security-by-design
- Governance embedded, not added later
- Vendor-aware, not vendor-locked

This roadmap prioritizes resilience, clarity and long-term trust.
